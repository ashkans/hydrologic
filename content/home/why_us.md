# Online Hydrological Model

A high-quality hydrology model is a critical step in flood studies. However, limitations like forcing data unavailability and uncertainty, and model parameter selection often cost a huge amount of time and money for the projects. What if you could get high quality hydrology outputs instantly from a dedicated system just by providing the catchment boundary? HydroLogic selects the most suitable pieces of information, uses a pre-calibrated model, and analyse uncertainties and provide a detailed report and data sets. Itâ€™s perfect for calculating design floods and flood event, analysing flood and drought indexes and the impacts of river discharges.
